# Matlab-Telecom-MonteCarlo-Simulator

Monte Carlo simulator for the wireless network communication

The aim is to plot the CDF and SINR relation
User locations are randomly created for every snapshot
Cell locations are chosen once, before simulation starts

The number of iterations, users and cells can be changed before the simulations starts
